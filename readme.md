In [rainfall_regression_v1](https://github.com/tyrneh/Regression-Projects-in-Python/blob/main/rainfall_regression_v1.ipynb), I predict the likelihood of RainTomorrow given some vector of regressor variables. I start with a naive OLS, then use LASSO to select features, and lastly Logit. For a detailed introduction, see [rainfall_regression_v1](https://github.com/tyrneh/Regression-Projects-in-Python/blob/main/rainfall_regression_v1.ipynb).

[sample_sql](https://github.com/tyrneh/Regression-Projects-in-Python/blob/main/sample_sql.sql) is a short mock sql query, completely unrelated to above regression.
