# Introduction

In the heterogeneous-agent neoclassical growth model with stochastic income:
- the representative household solves its utility maximization problem subject to budget constraint (households solve the same problem ex-ante, but face different realizations of income which causes heterogeneity when simulating over many individuals)
- the representative firm solves its profit maximization problem
- the market clears

Due to this being a heterogeneous agent model, we can achieve a non-degenerate stationary wealth distribution in the long run (after simulating for many periods). 
We calibrate this model to have a mean asset to mean income ratio of 3-4 to reflect [real-world data] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluence_in_the_United_States#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20as,household%20net%20worth%20is%20%24692%2C100.).

We're particularly interested in wealth inequality in the economy. In the real world, we find that
